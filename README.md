This Python program demonstrates how to perform a post-order traversal of a binary tree. In post-order traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in the following order:
Left subtree
Right subtree
Root node

Features:
Implements a basic binary tree structure using the Node class.
Traverses the tree in post-order and prints the node data.

Binary Tree Construction:
The binary tree is manually constructed in the following structure
           Siblings
          /         \
       Wanja       Akama
       /   \       /    \
  Valerie Moraa  Okeya   Tom

Post-Order Traversal:
This function visits nides in the post-order sequence
Traverses the left subtree.
Traverses the right subtree.
Visits the root node.

How to Run the Program:
python post_order_traversal.py

Example Output:
Valerie Moraa Wanja Okeya Tom Akama Siblings

Concepts Covered:
Binary tree structure.
Recursive traversal.
Post-order traversal algorithm.
