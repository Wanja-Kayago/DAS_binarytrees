**What is this code about**
This Python program demonstrates how to perform a post-order traversal of a binary tree. In post-order traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in the following order:
1. Left subtree
2. Right subtree
3. Root node

**Features:**
1. Implements a basic binary tree structure using the Node class.
2. Traverses the tree in post-order and prints the node data.

**Binary Tree Construction:**
The binary tree is manually constructed in the following structure
           Siblings
          /         \
       Wanja       Akama
       /   \       /    \
  Valerie Moraa  Okeya   Tom

**Post-Order Traversal:**
1. This function visits nides in the post-order sequence
2. Traverses the left subtree.
3. Traverses the right subtree.
4. Visits the root node.

**How to Run the Program:**
python post_order_traversal.py

**Example Output:**
Valerie Moraa Wanja Okeya Tom Akama Siblings

**Concepts Covered:**
1. Binary tree structure.
2. Recursive traversal.
3. Post-order traversal algorithm.
